      <abstract>This shapefile contains the administrative boundaries of 9 Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) located throughout the state of Alabama as of 2024. WMAs are publicly managed lands designated for conservation, wildlife habitat management, and recreational activities such as hunting and wildlife viewing. This dataset delineates the spatial extent of each WMA and provides attribute information such as WMA name and area.</abstract>
      <purpose>The dataset was created to support research, planning, and spatial analysis involving wildlife conservation, land cover classification, and habitat management in Alabama. It provides a consistent and accurate representation of WMA boundaries for use in GIS-based environmental studies and decision-making.</purpose>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The Wildlife Management Area (WMA) boundary shapefile was obtained from the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (ADCNR) in 2024. The dataset was imported into ArcGIS Pro. Attribute fields were reviewed and standardized to include WMA name, area (acres), and administrative region. Polygons were checked for topological consistency using the ArcGIS topology rules “Must Not Overlap” and “Must Not Have Gaps.” The shapefile was then clipped to the study extent and saved for integration with training and validation datasets.</procdesc>
